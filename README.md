# Diffusion Models Project

## Description

`diffusion_models` is a state-of-the-art Python implementation of diffusion models, which are a class of machine learning models that generate high-quality data by learning to reverse a diffusion process. This project provides tools for training, evaluating, and using diffusion models for a variety of tasks such as image generation and data augmentation.

## Installation

To install `diffusion_models`, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chikap421/diffusion_models.git
cd diffusion_models
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run a diffusion model, use the following command:

```bash
python diffusion_models.py

## Code Examples
Here's a quick example of how to generate images using diffusion_models:

from diffusion_models import DiffusionModel

model = DiffusionModel()
model.load_pretrained_weights('path_to_weights')
generated_images = model.generate()
